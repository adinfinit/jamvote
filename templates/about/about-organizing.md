# Organizing a jam

Here is a list of things and topics to consider while running a game jam. We also include recommendations and reasoning behind them, but as situations vary you are free to ignore them at your own peril.

## Set up emergency channels

Things will go wrong. Set up channels for people to communicate in case of emergencies.

## Jammers should register early

There's so much chaos at the end of the jam so it's better to get the
bureaucracy out of the way early. This way people won't have to worry about
registering at the last minute.

## Decide on target platforms

Decide on a target platform, otherwise you can end up with a build that only runs on a Windows Phone.

Usually good targets are: Web and Windows, however it's highly recommended to also create Mac and Linux builds.

## Timeline reminders

Remind people early and often about the deadlines. People are tired, stressed,
and focused on their projects; so time can slip out of their mind.

## Production build

Remind people at the start of the jam that they should make a production build. There are plenty of things that can go wrong during that stage.

Remind people to test the production build on a system that does not have the development tools. Requiring people to install "tool X", usually means they won't be able to get the game running.

Production builds should be compressed with `.zip`, since it's the only one that works across platforms. `7z`, `rar`, `tar`, `gzip` etc. require additional tools depending on the OS.

Remind to upload to a public location. Jammers often forget to change their sharing settings to allow downloading.

Best way is to let people outside the team to test the download and run the "production build". _e.g. There have been issues where people have used some audio/images that triggered Google Drive's automatic "copy protection"._

Remind people to start uploading and creating the final binary at least 1 hour before voting and presentations. There are plenty of things that can go wrong from compiling shaders, updating descriptions to uploading to a server.

## When game is broken

Have guidelines for how to behave when the game is not playable due to a technical issue.

## When game is unfinished

Have guidelines for how to behave when the game is unfinished. There are still ways for people to show off what they completed.

One option would be to create a video of what was completed. This would still allow some feedback from the voting.

The other is to skip voting on them and let them do a final presentation.
