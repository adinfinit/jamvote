# Scoring

Games are scored on the following aspects:

<dl>
<dt>Theme (1 &ndash; 5)</dt>
<dd>How well does the game interpret the jam theme?</dd>

<dt>Enjoyment (1 &ndash; 5)</dt>
<dd>How does the game generally feel to play?</dd>

<dt>Aesthetics (1 &ndash; 5)</dt>
<dd>How well is the story, art and audio executed?</dd>

<dt>Innovation (1 &ndash; 5)</dt>
<dd>Is there something novel in the game?</dd>

<dt>Bonus (0 &ndash; 2.5)</dt>
<dd>Is there anything exceptionally special about it?</dd>
</dl>

The **Overall** score is the weighted average of all
aspects: 5 \* (Theme + Enjoyment + Aesthetics + Innovation + Bonus) /
4.5, clamped to the range 1 – 5.

## Why have aspects?

Having multiple aspects encourages voters to think about games from
different angles and write more specific feedback. This helps jammers
learn what worked and what didn't. A single score would be simpler, but
it wouldn't tell you *why* a game scored the way it did and
the outcomes would be more subjective.

## Why these aspects?

Many categories were considered, but these were chosen to
cover the key qualities of a game while balancing different team
strengths — so that a "programmers team" won't necessarily win over
an "artists team".

**"Theme"** discourages premeditated games and encourages creativity.
Themes make jams more interesting, because you get to see how different
people interpret the same idea.

**"Enjoyment"** captures how the game feels to play. It could have been
called "Fun", but games can be stressful or sad and still be enjoyable.
It tries to capture two ideas: do you want to play it again, and how
much did it make you feel?

**"Aesthetics"** rewards games that are visually cohesive, have good
writing, suitable sound design, and feel like they belong together. It
could have been called "Graphics" or "Sound", but those labels make
people focus on looking "pretty". A grungy sketch style can be just as
effective as polished 3D art.

**"Innovation"** rewards trying something new. Novel games are more
memorable, even if the mechanics aren't fully balanced — which is
common when experimenting under time pressure.

**"Bonus"** captures everything else. Sometimes there's a
[quality without a name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Timeless_Way_of_Building#Summary) —
how all the pieces fit together, or some excellence where "5" just isn't
enough. Because it's highly subjective, it's weighted at 0.5 compared to
the other categories.

## Scoring statistics

Scores are calculated as a simple mean (average) of all votes. We
considered using a median or excluding outliers, but either approach
would make the scoring harder to understand or more likely to produce
ties.

A score becomes meaningful after **10 votes** — at that point a single
vote can shift the result by at most ~5%. After **30 votes**, which is
the standard threshold for a large sample, the result is quite stable.
In practice, most games receive significantly more votes than that.
