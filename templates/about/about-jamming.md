# How to jam?

## Registering

At the start of the jam, every participant should sign in to jamvote and
register with their name so organizers can resolve issues easily. Create
a team and add all members. People who have not signed up or joined a
team won't be able to vote.

## Submitting your game

Make sure you test your production build early. Test it on a machine
without your development tools. Compress builds as **`.zip`**, unless it's a browser game.
Upload to a public location and verify that anyone can download it
without signing in. Look for friends to test it.

## Voting

Once voting opens, you are randomly assigned 3 games to review. After
completing those, games are assigned one at a time. This ensures every
entry gets a balanced number of reviews.

You can change your votes on the Voting page by clicking Edit next to
the team name, for example after a hotfix. Try to leave as much feedback
as possible. Votes for your own team are not counted in the totals.

Only people who have signed up or joined a team can vote. Optionally,
organizers and judges can vote.

### Judges

Events can optionally designate judges. When judges are configured, the
final score is a weighted blend of the jammer average and the judge
average, based on the judge percentage set by the organizer.
