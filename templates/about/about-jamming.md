# How to jam?

## Registering

At the start of the jam, every participant should sign in to jamvote
using the link provided by the organizer. Register with your name so
organizers can resolve issues easily. Create a team and add all members.
People who have not signed up or joined a team won't be able to vote.

## Submitting your game

Before the deadline, you need to submit your game so others can play and
review it.

Make sure you test your production build early. Test it on a machine
without your development tools. Compress builds as **`.zip`**, unless
it's a browser game. Upload to a public location and verify that anyone
can download it without signing in. Ask someone outside your team to
test the download.

## Voting

Once voting opens, you are randomly assigned 3 games to review. For each
game, you play it, [score it on several aspects](/about/scoring), and
leave written feedback. After completing your initial 3, games are
assigned one at a time. This ensures every entry gets a balanced number
of reviews.

You can change your votes on the Voting page by clicking Edit next to
the team name, for example after a hotfix. Try to leave as much feedback
as possible — it helps other jammers learn and improve. Votes for your
own team are not counted in the totals.

Only people who have signed up or joined a team can vote. Optionally,
organizers and judges can vote.

### Judges

Events can optionally have designated judges. When judges are configured,
the final score is a weighted blend of the jammer average and the judge
average, based on the judge percentage set by the organizer. As a
jammer, you don't need to do anything different — just vote normally.
