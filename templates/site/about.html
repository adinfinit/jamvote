	<h1>About jamvote</h1>

	<p>
		jamvote is a voting tool for game jams. It helps organizers run a
		peer-review process where every participant gets to play and rate the
		other entries.
	</p>

	<h2>How to jam?</h2>

	<h3>Before the jam</h3>

	<p>
		Organizers should decide on target platforms for builds. Good defaults
		are Web and Windows, though Mac and Linux builds are recommended. Set up
		a dedicated communication channel for emergencies during voting.
	</p>

	<h3>Registering</h3>

	<p>
		At the start of the jam, every participant should sign in to jamvote and
		register with their name so organizers can resolve issues easily. Create
		a team and add all members. Only people on a team can vote, with the
		exception of the judges.
	</p>

	<h3>Submitting your game</h3>

	<p>
		Make sure you can produce a working build early. Test it on a machine
		without your development tools. Compress builds as
		<strong><code>.zip</code></strong> since it works across all platforms.
		Upload to a public location and verify that anyone can download it
		without signing in.
	</p>

	<p>
		Start uploading your final build at least 1 hour before the deadline. If
		you cannot get a working build, upload a video so reviewers can still
		see your game. When you push a fix, update all your links.
	</p>

	<h3>Voting</h3>

	<p>
		Once voting opens, you are randomly assigned 3 games to review. After
		completing those, games are assigned one at a time. This ensures every
		entry gets a balanced number of reviews as quickly as possible.
	</p>

	<p>
		You can change your votes on the Voting page by clicking Edit next to
		the team name, for example after a hotfix. Try to leave as much feedback
		as possible. Votes for your own team are not counted in the totals.
	</p>

	<h3>For organizers</h3>

	<p>
		Make sure teams and users are properly linked and approved. Linked means
		the names on the teams page match the user profiles. Approved means the
		user is able to vote. This takes some manual oversight and reminding
		jammers to sign in and create their team.
	</p>

	<h3>Judges</h3>

	<p>
		Events can optionally designate judges. When judges are configured, the
		final score is a weighted blend of the jammer average and the judge
		average, based on the judge percentage set by the organizer.
	</p>

	<h2>Scoring</h2>

	<p>Games are scored on the following aspects:</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>Theme (1 &ndash; 5)</dt>
		<dd>How well does the game interpret the jam theme?</dd>

		<dt>Enjoyment (1 &ndash; 5)</dt>
		<dd>How does the game generally feel to play?</dd>

		<dt>Aesthetics (1 &ndash; 5)</dt>
		<dd>How well is the story, art and audio executed?</dd>

		<dt>Innovation (1 &ndash; 5)</dt>
		<dd>Is there something novel in the game?</dd>

		<dt>Bonus (0 &ndash; 2.5)</dt>
		<dd>Is there anything exceptionally special about it?</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>
		The <strong>Overall</strong> score is the weighted average of all
		aspects: 5 * (Theme + Enjoyment + Aesthetics + Innovation + Bonus) /
		4.5, clamped to the range 1 &ndash; 5.
	</p>

	<h3>Why have aspects?</h3>

	<p>
		The voting could be done with a single slider from 0 to 5, but having
		multiple aspects allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive evaluation
		of games. Each aspect provides a different perspective on the game,
		allowing voters to consider various facets of its quality. This
		approach also helps to ensure that the voting process is fair and
		balanced, as it takes into account a range of factors that contribute
		to a game's overall quality. Having people write specific feedback
		about different aspects of the game allows jammers to improve their
		games and learn from each other.
	</p>

	<h3>Why these aspects?</h3>

	<p>
		Many aspects were considered, but these were the most important ones
		and seemed to cover the key qualities of a game. These scoring
		categories act as goals for people to think about. They also try to
		balance abilities between different groups, so that the "programmers
		team" won't necessarily win over the "artists team".
	</p>

	<p>
		"Theme" is a crucial aspect for game jams. It discourages people
		from coming with premeditated games and encourages creativity.
		Themes in general make jams more interesting, because you can see
		how other people interpret the theme and create unique games.
	</p>

	<p>
		"Enjoyment" is another crucial aspect. It could also have been called
		"Fun", "Engagement", "Creativity", or "Playability". However, these
		don't fully capture the breadth of what games can be. Games can be
		stressful or sad and still be enjoyable. Overall, this tries to
		capture two ideas:
		<ul>
			<li>Do you want to play this game again?</li>
			<li>How much did the game change your perspective?</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		"Aesthetics" rewards games that are visually cohesive, have suitable
		sound design, and feel like they belong together. There are many ways
		that games can excel besides gameplay, such as visuals, audio,
		narrative, character design, and world-building. Aesthetics tries to
		capture all of these. It could have been called "Graphics" or
		"Sound", but those labels can make people focus on looking "pretty".
		Games can be simple or ugly and still suit the experience. For
		example, a grungy and sketchy aesthetic can create a gritty and
		oppressive atmosphere.
	</p>

	<p>
		"Innovation" rewards people for trying something new. Coming up with
		new things in a short time often means that the gameplay mechanics
		cannot be balanced, hurting the enjoyment of the game. However, novel
		games are more memorable than a remake of a classic. Innovation can
		happen in many ways, such as new gameplay mechanics, new art styles,
		or new sound design. It's important to remember that innovation
		doesn't always mean creating something completely new, but also
		improving upon existing ideas.
	</p>

	<p>
		The "Bonus" category captures everything else, including things that
		are not covered by the other categories. Sometimes there's a
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Timeless_Way_of_Building#Summary">quality without a name</a>,
		something that is difficult to describe but is important to the game.
		It can be how all the pieces fit together, how the game makes you
		feel, or some excellence in a specific area where "5" just isn't
		enough. However, this is a very subjective category, so it is
		weighted at 0.5 compared to the other categories.

	<h3>Scoring statistics</h3>

	<p>
		The scoring tries to be as fair as possible with the number of votes
		available. We use a simple mean to calculate the score, because it is
		easy to understand and fair enough. A median could be a better
		indicator of overall quality, as it is less influenced by extreme
		values; similarly, excluding outliers could improve accuracy. However,
		either approach would make the scoring more complicated to understand.
	</p>

	<p>
		We use 10 as the minimum number of votes to consider a score
		reliable. At that point a single vote can change the score by at most
		~5%, which can still affect the ranking, but there is no easy way to
		get better accuracy with that few votes. In practice, most games
		receive significantly more votes than that, which makes the scoring
		more reliable.
